Game Version: 0.1a


About This Game:
    A classic brick-breaking game built with HTML, CSS, & Javascript. HTML Canvas is used.

    Your goal is to break all the bricks, using the paddle to return the ball towards the bricks each time. 
    Rounds initiate when you press spacebar. You may choose to launch the ball at any spot of your choice.
    Clearing all bricks will result in a victory, while missing the ball will result in a loss of a life.
    When all lives have been exhausted, the game will end - you lost. 
    
    You may restart the round when the restart button appears.
    Pressing Escape at any time will pause the game.


Features: 
    + Paddle control via left & right arrow keys
    + Ball launch via spacebar
    + Current score display
    + 'Game Over' or 'You Win!' message when all bricks are cleared or when there are no more lives
    + Pause game via Escape key


Work In Progress:
    - Remember high scores and display on screen
    - Sound effects for ball bounce, brick break, and other in-game events
    - Different levels & brick configurations
